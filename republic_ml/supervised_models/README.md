# Supervised Learning Models

A class of models which 'learn' from classified, labelled data.  These models fit a function based on input -> output mappings, and this function may then be used to answer questions on future, unseen observations of this data.  

## Linear regression
A simple model which derives the linear equation, to generate a line-of-best-fit, for a dependent variable (`y`) with respect to an independent variable (`x`) for a given data set.  The line can then be used to estimate the value of a point for which no data yet exists (commonly referred to as `y_bar`).  

In it's simplest form, linear regression involves calculating the `slope` and `y-intercept` values of the line-of-best-fit, to populate the equation:

Where coefficients `a` and `b` are defined as:
