# Machine Learning from Scratch

Build common machine learning models/algorithms from scratch using primarily base Python, and occasionally the likes of Numpy for more efficient linear algebra operations.

## Model Classes

Models will be split into 4 primary classes:

1) Supervised Classification

2) Supervised Regression

3) Unsupervised Classification

4) Unsupervised Regression
