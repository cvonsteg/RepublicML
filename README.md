# Machine Learning from Scratch

Build common machine learning models/algorithms from scratch using primarily base Python, and occasionally the likes of Numpy for more efficient linear algebra operations.

## Model Classes

Models will be split into 4 primary classes:
    1) Supervised Classification
    2) Supervised Regression
    3) Unsupervised Classification
    4) Unsupervised Regression
